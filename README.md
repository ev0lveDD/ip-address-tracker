## General info
This project consisted of creating IP Address Tracker with the help of two different API's. To get the IP Address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. To generate the map, I will use LeafletJS.

Your users should be able to:
* See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
* Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
* View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size

The project was written in NEXT.JS, as part of a consolidation of the acquired knowledge as well as fetching and using the data from one API to another.
